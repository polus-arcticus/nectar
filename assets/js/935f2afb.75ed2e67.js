In the case of swap routing we can than propose alternative algorithms for choosing such counter parties. Why route through a normal pool that is taking fees as profit, when one can route through a pool or two that offers some sort of positive externality?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"why-nectar/drips-and-attestations":{"id":"why-nectar/drips-and-attestations","title":"Autonomous Agents, Drips and Attestations","description":"In modern finance cash flow is more important than cash. With predictable, and provable cash flows, one can gain access to credit. Nectar provides a natural means to create autonomous agents that can handle the logic for providing drips and batching attestations.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"why-nectar/hypercompute-horizon":{"id":"why-nectar/hypercompute-horizon","title":"Hypercompute on the Horizon","description":"Application Specific Hardware like ASICs and H100 are already here, and will continue to become more important as neuromorphic computing advances such as mushroom computing, silicon photonics, memristor crossbars and generalized quantum compute come into existence. Crypto makes a natural candidate for tools like quantum finance","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
