# Nectar

Nectar turns liquidity pools into energy banks for the swarm.

## Introduction

Uniswap v4 hooks allow executing custom logic during key phases of the automated market lifecycle.

Coophive.network enables this custom logic to be computed at the edge in exchange for cryptocurrencies.

By rerouting swap fees into edge compute jobs we enable a wide range of desirable properties, including but not limited to

- creating positive externalities with swap fees through funding computational public goods

- elucidating the economically efficient liveliness of compute jobs

- investing in autonomous agents
